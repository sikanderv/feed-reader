# feed-reader
A JavaScript-based feed reader

The app can be accessed at:

https://secure-sierra-15006.herokuapp.com/


Current version supports feeds from:

1. BBC Sport
2. Tech Crunch
3. The Guardian

(This will be updated to retrieve any valid feed in the next version.)

HOW TO USE:

1. Click on the button related to the feed you would like to read.
2. App displays all the current articles from the feed.
3. Click on 'Article' button that is present alongside each article to open the article in a new window.
   (Note: Currently, this will not take you to the actual website. A new button will be provided soon to visit the website itself.)
4. Click on 'Statistics' button to see a breakup of the # of times each letter appears in the 'Description' of the article.

Note:  Clicking on the 'Article' button will remove the article from list of articles displayed on the home page, under the assumption
that the user has already read the article and the app will update itself to show only 'unread' articles.

Happy feeding...err...reading!
